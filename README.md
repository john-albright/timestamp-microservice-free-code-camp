# APIs and Microservices Project 1/5
## [Timestamp Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/timestamp-microservice)

The project contains an index html with links demonstrating the functionality of the API. 
If the route /api/ + a unix time or a date written in numbers is entered, the API returns
a JSON object with the original time and its subsequent conversion. If the date entered is
invalid, a JSON object with the key-value pair error and Invalid Date will be displayed.
