# APIs and Microservices Project 1/5
## [Timestamp Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/apis-and-microservices/apis-and-microservices-projects/timestamp-microservice)

This project contains an index html with links demonstrating the functionality of the API. If the route /api/ followed by a unix timestamp (any integer) or a date written in a standard format (e.g. yyyy-mm-dd, mmm-dd-yyyy, etc.) is entered, the API returns a JSON object with the time entered and its subsequent conversion. If the date entered is an invalid date or improperly formatted, a JSON object with the key-value pair error and Invalid Date will be displayed.
