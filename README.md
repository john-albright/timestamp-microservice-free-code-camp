# Free Code Camp: Back End Development and APIs Project 1/5
## [Timestamp Microservice](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis/back-end-development-and-apis-projects/timestamp-microservice)

This project is the first of five projects to be completed for FreeCodeCamp's fifth of six JavaScript certificate: [Back End Development and APIs](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/back-end-development-and-apis). The API returns a JSON object with a time as a unix time value and the time in GMT (Greenwich Mean Time) or UTC (Coordinated Universal Time). If the route /api/ followed by a unix timestamp (any integer) or a date written in a standard format (e.g. yyyy-mm-dd, mmm-dd-yyyy, etc.) is entered, the API returns a JSON object with the time entered and its subsequent conversion. If the date entered is an invalid date or improperly formatted, a JSON object with the key-value pair error and Invalid Date will be displayed. If no date is entered, the information concerning the current time will be shown in JSON format.
